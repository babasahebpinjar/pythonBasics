 Two types :
    1. Interpreted languages   
    
                        Programming Code   ===> Interpreter   ==+> Execution
    
    Interpreting reads your code line by line and executes directly at runtime in the language understood by your machine. e: python ruby
 
    2.  Compiled languages
    
                  Programming Code ==> Cimplier ==> Binary Code(0,1)  ==> Program Execution
